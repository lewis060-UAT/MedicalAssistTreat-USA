Input files and coding methodologies from paper titled, "Geographic Disparities in Accessibility to Long-Term Methadone and Buprenorphine Treatment among Adults in the United States" by Mitchell and Colleagues (currently under peer-review).


Please note that due to ESRI's StreetMap Premium licensing agreements, we are unable to share the origin-destination (O-D) travel time matrix used for many analyses. We do share other input files and results. The data structure of the O-D matrix is shared in this repository, as well as, code used to generate results.
